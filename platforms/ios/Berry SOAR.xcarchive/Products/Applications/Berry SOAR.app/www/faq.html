    <h4>How do I change my SOAR date?</h4><p>If you need to change your SOAR date,
    call the Office of Admissions and they will schedule a SOAR date that works
    better for you.&nbsp;
    </p><br>
    
    <h4>How do I change my major?</h4><p>Students will meet with their advisors
    during SOAR to confirm their class schedule for the fall. If they want to
    change their major they can do so during this time and can also change
    their classes if necessary.&nbsp;
    </p><br>
    
    <h4>What is the foreign language placement test?</h4><p>Transfer students and
    incoming freshmen who have studied a foreign language in high school or at
    another college/university and want to continue study in that language at
    Berry College need to take the&nbsp;<strong><a href=
    "http://webcape.byuhtrsc.org/nwcregister.php?acct=berry" target="_blank"
    title="WebCAPE Online Placement Exam">WebCAPE Online Placement
    Exam</a></strong>. This online exam is available in French, German and
    Spanish. You should take the online placement exam before coming to Summer
    Advising and Orientation (SOAR) so that you will know the foreign language
    class in which to register.&nbsp;
    </p><br>
    
    <h4>Will I get to meet my roommate at SOAR?</h4><p>If your roommate for next
    year attends the same SOAR session as you, you will room with them during
    SOAR so that you can get to know them and discuss plans for your
    room.&nbsp;
    </p><br>
    
    <h4>Will I get to see my residence hall room while I am at SOAR?</h4><p>The
    residence halls at Berry are used to accommodate a number of events on
    campus during the summer so most students will not be able to see their
    actual room. Residence Life will provide floor plans for all residence
    halls. You might also want to check out Residence Lifeâ€™s web page for more
    information on what to bring, room layouts, etc.&nbsp;
    </p><br>
    
    <h4>What do I need to bring to SOAR?</h4><p>
    It's suggested that each student brings the following:      
    <ul>
        <li>Pillow</li>
            <li>X-long twin linens</li>
        <li>Towel</li>
        <li>Alarm clock</li>
        <li>Toiletries</li> 
        <li>Athletic wear for optional activities</li> 
        <li>Comfortable clothes and shoes</li> 
        <li>All necessary forms and papers</li> </ul>
          </p><br>
    
    <h4>What should I wear?</h4><p>Dress is casual so it is not necessary to dress
    up for the banquet on the first night. Dress for hot weather and be
    prepared for possible rain.&nbsp;
    </p><br>
    
    <h4>Are my meals provided?&nbsp;</h4><p>You will have to get breakfast and
    lunch on your own the first day of SOAR. Your orientation fee covers the
    cost of the dinner banquet for you and two parents as well as breakfast and
    lunch on the second day.&nbsp;
    </p><br>
    
    <h4>What are the overnight accommodations?</h4><p>All students will be staying
    in an assigned residence hall room on campus overnight. Parents will need
    to make arrangements for accommodations from the list of recommended
    Rome-area hotel/motels.&nbsp;
    </p><br>
    
    <h4>Do I still stay overnight on campus if I am a commuter?&nbsp;</h4><p>All
    students are encouraged to stay on campus overnight during SOAR, even if
    they will not be living in the residence halls in the fall. This gives
    every student the opportunity to participate in the late-night
    entertainment, socialize with the other incoming students, and get to know
    their SOAR leaders better.&nbsp;
    </p><br>
    
    <h4>What kind of transportation is available to get to Berry
    from&nbsp;Hartsfield-Jackson Airport&nbsp;if I don't have a
    car?&nbsp;</h4><p>Most of the time there are a number of students who travel
    to the airport or to Atlanta from Berry, so it might&nbsp;be
    most&nbsp;convenient to ask a friend.&nbsp; If not, there a couple of safe
    and affordable&nbsp;shuttle services that&nbsp;provide services to&nbsp;and
    from&nbsp;Hartsfield-Jackson Airport.&nbsp; 
    <br><b>Shuttle
    Tran:</b> 706-235-5466 or 1-800-556-5466<br>
    <b>Best Journey:</b> 706-234-7337
